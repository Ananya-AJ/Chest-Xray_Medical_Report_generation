Project Goals:
The objective of this project is to leverage the power of large language models for generating textual medical reports from chest x-ray images. By utilizing the multimodal capabilities of large language models, we aim to develop an application that takes a chest x-ray image as input and generates a medical report from the x-ray, in a similar fashion as a physician or medical practitioner would. In addition to that, we also provide a chatbot facility built using Microsoftâ€™s Semantic Kernel that can look at the generated report and answer user questions based on the report as well as answer other general queries about chest-related questions. Therefore, it is a complete package that gives the user the diagnosis and observations from chest x-ray as well as give the user the ability to get specific answers to their questions about the report or general chest-related conditions.
